# Symmetry in a groupoid setting 

## Groupoids and groupoid actions

::: defn
A *groupoid* is a small category in which every morphism is an
isomorphism, i.e. is invertible.
:::

The reference for the following more detailed form of the definition is
[@Kum].

::: defn
A groupoid $\Xi$ is a set endowed with two maps
$$\label{eq:groupoidOperations}
\cdot:{\Xi}^{(2)}\rightarrow\Xi, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, ^*  : \Xi\rightarrow \Xi$$
called *multiplication* and *inverse* respectively, where $\Xi^{(2)}$ is
a subset of $\Xi\times\Xi$ called the set of *composable elements*.
These operations satisfy the following properties:

1.  $(\gamma^*)^*=\gamma$ for every $\gamma\in\Xi$,

2.  if $(\gamma,\alpha),(\alpha,\beta)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ then
    $(\gamma\alpha,\beta),(\gamma,\alpha\beta)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ and
    $(\gamma\alpha)\beta=\gamma(\alpha\beta)$,

3.  if $(\gamma^*,\gamma)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ and if
    $(\gamma,\alpha)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ then $\gamma^*(\gamma\alpha)=\alpha$,

4.  if $(\gamma,\gamma^*)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ and if
    $(\beta,\gamma)\in\Xi^{(2)}$ then $(\beta\gamma)\gamma^*=\beta$.

If $\gamma\in\Xi$, $\s(\gamma)=\gamma^*\gamma$ and
$\r(\gamma)=\gamma\gamma^*$ are the *domain* and *range* of $\gamma$
respectively. The pair $(\gamma, \alpha)$ is composable if and only if
$\s(\gamma)=\r(\alpha)$. We define $\Xi^{(0)}:=\s(\Xi)=\r(\Xi)$ as the
*unit space* of $\Xi$.\
Usually a groupoid is denoted as
$$\Xi \stackrel{\s\text{,}\r}{\overrightarrow{\rightarrow}} \Xi^{(0)}.$$
Other useful subset of the groupoid $\Xi$ is the *isotropy group* of a
given $v\in\Xi^{(0)}$ which it is defined by
$$\Xi_v^v:=\left\{\gamma\in\Xi|\,\, \s(\gamma)=\r(\gamma)=v\right\}.$$
The isotropy group of $v$ if often seen as $\Xi_v^v=\Xi_v\cap\Xi^v$
where $\Xi_v:=\s^{-1}(\{v\})$ and $\Xi^v:=\r^{-1}(\{v\})$ and these are
called the $\s$-fibre and $\r$-fibre respectively. One also uses the
*isotropic subgroupoid* of $\Xi$ written as
$\text{Iso}(\Xi):=\cup_{v\in\Xi^{(0)}}\Xi_v^v$.

## Fell bundles

::: defn
Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological space. A *bundle* over $X$ is a pair
$\<\mathscr{C},\pi\>$, where $\mathscr{C}$ is a Hausdorff topological
space and $\pi:\mathscr{C}\to X$ is a continuous open surjection.
:::

The concept of Fell bundles over groups introduced here can be found in
[@Ex2 Def. 16.1].

::: defn
A *Fell Bundle* (also known as a *C$^*$-algebraic bundle*) over a group
$\normalfont{\G}$ is a bundle $\mathscr{C}=\<\mathscr C,\pi\>$ over
$\normalfont{\G}$, where we define $\mathfrak{C}_g:=\pi^{-1}(\{g\})$ as
the *fibers*. In addition it is equipped with continuous multiplication
and involution operations
$$\cdot:\mathscr{C}\times\mathscr{C}\rightarrow\mathscr{C}, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, ^*  : \mathscr{C}\rightarrow \mathscr{C},$$
satisfying the following properties for all $g,h\in\normalfont{\G}$ and
all $b,c\in\mathscr{C}$

1.  $\mathfrak{C}_g\cdot \mathfrak{C}_h \subset \mathfrak{C}_{gh}$,

2.  the product $\cdot$ is bilinear on
    $\mathfrak{C}_g\times \mathfrak{C}_h$ to $\mathfrak{C}_{gh}$,

3.  the product $\cdot$ on $\mathscr{C}$ is associative,

4.  $\Vert b \cdot c \Vert_{\pi(bc)} \leq \Vert b \Vert_{\pi(b)} \Vert c \Vert_{\pi(c)}$,

5.  $(\mathfrak{C}_g)^*\subset \mathfrak{C}_{g^{-1}}$,

6.  For each $g\in\normalfont{\G}$, $^*$ restricted to $\mathfrak{C}_g$
    is conjugate-linear from $\mathfrak{C}_g$ to
    $\mathfrak{C}_{g^{-1}}$,

7.  $(bc)^*=c^*b^*$,

8.  $b^{**}=b$,

9.  $\Vert b^* \Vert_{\pi(b^*)}=\Vert b\Vert_{\pi(b)}$,

10. $\Vert b^*b \Vert_{e}=\Vert b\Vert^2_{\pi(b)}$,

11. $b^*b\geq 0$ in $\mathfrak{C}_\e$.

We will write the Fell bundle in the form
$\mathscr{C}:=(\mathfrak{C}_g)_{g\in\normalfont{\G}}$. It is important
to note that $\mathfrak{C}_\e$ is a C$^*$-algebra with the restricted
operations, it is often refered as the unit fiber algebra [@Ex2 p. 124].
:::

Consider the Fell Bundle $\mathscr{C}=\<\mathscr C,\pi\>$ over the
locally compact Hausdorff group $\normalfont{\G}$. On the space
$$\Ce_c(\G,\mathscr{C}):=\left\{ \varphi:\G\to\mathscr{C}\,\, \text{ continuous };\,\, \varphi(g)\in \mathfrak{C}_g\,\,\forall g\in\G \,\, \textrm{ s.t. supp}(\varphi) \textrm{ is compact} \right\},$$
one defines the convolution product
$$\varphi\star\psi(g):= \int_\G \varphi(gh^{-1}) \psi(h)dh.$$ Then we
define $L^1(\G,\mathscr{C})$ as a Banach $^*$-algebra by completing
$\Ce_c(\G,\mathscr{C})$ with respect to the norm
$$\Vert \varphi \Vert_{L^1(\G,\mathscr{C})}:=\sum_{g\in\G}\Vert\varphi(g)\Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_g}\,\, \textrm{ for }\,\, \varphi\in \Ce_c(\G,\mathscr{C}).$$

## Fell bundles over groupoids

We introduce the concept of Fell bundles over groupoids which can be
found in [@Kum; @MW; @Yam].

::: defn
A *Fell Bundle* (also known as a *C$^*$-algebraic bundle*) over a
discrete groupoid $\Xi$ is a bundle $\mathscr{C}=\<\mathscr C,\pi\>$
over $\Xi$, where we define
$\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma}:=\pi^{-1}(\{\gamma\})$ as the *fibers* and we set
$$\mathscr{C}^{(2)}:=\left\{(c_1,c_2)\in\mathscr{C}\times\mathscr{C};\,\,(\pi(c_1),\pi(c_2))\in\Xi^{(2)}\right\}.$$
In addition it is equipped with continuous multiplication and involution
operations
$$\cdot:\mathscr{C}^{(2)}\rightarrow\mathscr{C}, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, ^*  : \mathscr{C}\rightarrow \mathscr{C},$$
satisfying the following properties

1.  $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_1}\cdot \mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_2} \subset \mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_1\gamma_2}$,
    if $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\in\Xi^{(2)}$,

2.  the product $\cdot$ is bilinear on
    $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_1}\times \mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_2}$ for every
    $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\in\Xi^{(2)}$,

3.  the product $\cdot$ on $\mathscr{C}$ is associative, this means
    $(c_1 \cdot c_2) \cdot c_3 = c_1 \cdot( \cdot c_2 \cdot c_3 )$ in
    $\mathfrak{C_{\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3}}$ if
    $(c_1,c_2)\in \mathscr{C}^{(2)}$ and
    $(c_2,c_3)\in \mathscr{C}^{(2)}$, where
    $c_i\in\mathscr{C}_{\gamma_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$,

4.  $\Vert c_1 \cdot c_2 \Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_1\gamma_2}} \leq \Vert c_1 \Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_1}} \Vert c_2 \Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma_2}}$
    if $(c_1,c_2)\in\mathscr{C}^{(2)}$,

5.  $(\mathfrak{C}_\gamma)^*\subset \mathfrak{C}_{\gamma^*}$ for every
    $\gamma\in\Xi$, which could be written as $\pi(c^*)=\pi(c)^*$ for
    every $c\in\mathscr{C}$,

6.  For each $\gamma\in\Xi$, $^*$ restricted to $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma}$
    is conjugate-linear from $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma}$ to
    $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma^*}$,

7.  $(c_1c_2)^*=c_2^*c_1^*$ for every $(c_1,c_2)\in\mathscr{C}^{(2)}$,

8.  $c^{**}=c$ for every $c\in\mathscr{C}$,

9.  $\Vert c^* \Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma}^*}=\Vert c\Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma}}$
    for every $c\in\mathfrak{C}_\gamma$,

10. $\Vert c^*\cdot c \Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma^*\gamma}}=\Vert c\Vert_{\mathfrak{C}_\gamma}^2$
    for every $c\in\mathfrak{C}_\gamma$,

11. $c^*c\geq 0$ in $\mathfrak{C}_{\gamma^*\gamma}$ for every
    $c\in\mathfrak{C}_\gamma$.

We will continue to write the Fell bundle in the form
$\mathscr{C}:=(\mathfrak{C}_g)_{g\in\Xi}$.
:::

::: remark
Note that if $\gamma\in\Xi^{(0)}$ then
$\mathfrak{C}_\gamma:=\pi^{-1}(\{\gamma\})$ is a C$^*$-algebra (with
norm, multiplication and involution induced from the bundle).

## Rigidly symmetric and hypersymmetric groupoids

Let $\Xi$ be a discrete groupoid, with unit spce $\Xi^{(0)}\!=:\!U$ ,
domain and range maps $\s$ and $\r$  respectively. The set of composable
pairs is $\Xi^{(2)}\!:=\{(x,y)\!\mid\!\textrm{ r}(y)=\textrm{ d}(x)\}$ .

::: defn
Let $\Gamma:\mathfrak{B}\rightarrow \textrm{End}(\mathcal{E})$ be a
representation of the Banach $^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{B}$ in the Banach
space $\mathcal{E}$. The representation is called *preunitary* if there
exists a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, a topologically irreducible
$^*$-representation
$\Pi:\mathfrak{B}\rightarrow \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H})$ and an injective
linear bounded operator $V:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ such that
$$V\Gamma(\phi)=\Pi(\phi)V,\,\,\forall \phi\in\mathfrak{B}.$$
:::

Our interest in this notion lies in the next characterization, taken
from [@Lp]:

::: theorem
The Banach $^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{B}$ is symmetric if and only if all
its non-trivial algebraically irreducible representations are
preunitary.
:::

An interesting object on the representation of Fell Bundles is *the Hahn
algebra* $\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ adapted to this
structure [@MW Ch. 1], which in our discrete case is formed by the
sections $\Phi:\Xi\to\mathfrak C$ (thus satisfying
$\Phi(x)\in\mathfrak C_x$ for every $x\in\Xi$) such that *the Hahn-type
norm* $$\label{parts}
\p\!\Phi\p_{\infty,1}\,:=\max\Big\{\sup_{u\in U}\sum_{\textrm{ r}(x)=u}\!\p\!\Phi(x)\!\p_{\mathfrak C_x}\,,\,\sup_{u\in U}\sum_{\textrm{ d}(x)=u}\!\p\!\Phi(x)\!\p_{\mathfrak C_x}\!\Big\}$$
is finite. It is a Banach $^*$-algebra under the multiplication
$$\label{tiplication}
(\Phi\star \Psi)(x):=\sum_{yz=x}\Phi(y)\bullet\Psi\big(z)$$ and the
involution $$\label{tion}
\Phi^\star(x):=\Phi\big(x^{-1}\big)^\bu.$$ The space
$C_\textrm{ c}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ of finitely-supported sections
forms a dense $^*$-algebra of the Hahn algebra. The complexity of the
multiplication, largely responsable for the generality of the emerging
algebras, comes both from the complexity of the 'inner' Fell
multiplication $\bu$ and from the groupoid-type convolution inherent to
the formula.

We need some special Fell bundles associated to Hilbert bundles
$\mathscr H\!:=\bigsqcup_{u\in U}\h_u$ over the unit space; here the
fact that $\Xi$ is discrete will be crucial. For $u,v\in U$ we set
$\mathbb B(\h_u,\h_v)\equiv\mathbb B(u,v)$ for the Banach space of all
bounded linear operators $A:\h_u\to\h_v$ . Taking advantage of the norm,
the multiplication $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbb B(\h_w,\h_v)\!\times\!\mathbb B(\h_u,\h_w)&\to\mathbb B(\h_u,\h_v)\\
    (A,B) &\mapsto A\circ B
\end{aligned}$$ and the involution $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathbb B(\h_u,\h_v)&\to\mathbb B(\h_v,\h_u)\\
    A&\mapsto A^*,
\end{aligned}$$ one constructs the Fell bundle
$$\mathbb B^\mathscr H\!:=\!\!\bigsqcup_{(u,v)\in U\times U}\!\mathbb B(u,v)\to U\!\!\times\!U$$
over the pair groupoid.

Actually we are interested in the Fell Bundle $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathscr B^\mathscr H\!&:=\!\bigsqcup_{x\in\Xi}\mathfrak B_x\overset{p}{\to}\Xi\,,
\end{aligned}$$ with fibres
$\mathfrak{B}_x:=\mathbb{B}\big(\s(x),\r(x)\big)$ and the structure
$$(A_x,B_y)\in \left(\mathscr{\mathscr B^\mathscr H}\right)^{(2)} \quad \quad \text{ if and only if }\quad \quad s(x)=r(y),$$
where we can see
$A_x\cdot B_y\in \mathfrak{B}_{xy}=\mathbb{B}(s(y),r(x))$. The Fell
Bundle $\mathscr B^\mathscr H$ is called the pull-back Fell bundle of
$\mathbb B^\mathscr H$ through the groupoid morphism
$(\s,\r):\Xi\to U\!\times\!U$ which it is also denoted by
$(\s,\r)^*(\mathbb B^\mathscr H)$ (see [@Kum Rem. 2.6]).

::: defn
[]{#groupsymmetric label="groupsymmetric"}

1.  The discrete groupoid $\Xi$ is called *symmetric* if the convolution
    Banach $^*$-algebra $\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi)$ is symmetric.

2.  The discrete groupoid $\Xi$ is called *rigidly symmetric* if, given
    any Hilbert bundle $\mathscr H\!=\bigsqcup_{x\in X}\h_x$ over its
    unit space, the Banach $^*$-algebra
    $\ell^{\infty,1}\big(\Xi\,\big\vert\,\mathscr B^\mathscr H\big)$ is
    symmetric.

3.  The discrete groupoid $\Xi$ is called *hypersymmetric* if given any
    Fell bundle $\mathscr C\!=\bigsqcup_{x\in\Xi}\mathfrak C _x$ , the
    Banach $^*$-algebra $\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ is
    symmetric.
:::

It is clear that rigid symmetry implies symmetry; just take the constant
field $\h_u\!:=\mathbb C$ for every $u$ . As said in the Introduction,
even for discrete groups it is still unknown if the two notions
coincide.

::: theorem
[]{#principala label="principala"} For a discrete groupoid, rigid
symmetry and hypersymmetry coincide.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* The fact that hypersymmetry implies rigid symmetry is obvious,
since $\mathscr B^\mathscr H$ is a particular type of discrete groupoid
Fell bundle. So we need to show the converse implication.

We will first prove a result concerning the existence of isometric
representations of such Fell bundles. We rely on the integrated form of
such a representation. In general the connections between
representations and their integrated forms is an intricate issue (see
[@MW Sect. 3,4,5] for instance), especially at the level of
'disintegration', but for discrete $\Xi$ this simplifies a lot. We will
sketch the constructions we need without saying how they fit the general
case. But just a hint: the counting measure on $U$ is invariant with
respect to the Haar system composed of counting measures on the fibers
of the discrete groupoid. So one is given an arbitrary Fell bundle
$\mathscr C=\bigsqcup_{x\in\Xi}\mathfrak C _x\overset{q}{\to}\Xi$ . Let
$$\pi:\mathscr C\to\mathscr B^\mathscr H\!=\bigsqcup_{x\in\Xi}\mathbb B\big(\h_{\textrm{ s}(x)},\h_{\textrm{ r}(x)}\big)$$
be a representation, where $\mathscr H=\bigsqcup_{u\in U}\h _u$ is a
Hilbert bundle over $U$ . In our context this just means that $\pi$ is a
morphism of Fell bundles. Its integrated form
$\Pi:\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)\to\mathbb B\Big(\bigoplus_{u\in U}\h_u\big)$
is defined by $$\label{surpr}
\big[\Pi(\Phi)h\big](u):=\!\sum_{\textrm{ r}(x)=u}\!\pi\big[\Phi(x)\big]h\big[\textrm{ s}(x)\big]\,,\quad\forall\,h\in\bigoplus_{u\in U}\h_u\,.$$
We embed $\mathfrak C_v$ into
$C_\textrm{ c}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)\subset\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$
setting for each $a\in\mathfrak C_v$
$$(\te_v a)(x):=a\ \ \textrm{ if}\ \ x=v\,,\quad(\te_v a)(x):=0_{\mathfrak C_x}\ \ \textrm{ if}\ \ x\ne v\,$$
and we get from [\[surpr\]](#surpr){reference-type="eqref"
reference="surpr"}
$$\big[\Pi(\te_v a)h\big](u)=\pi(a)h(v)\ \ \textrm{ if}\ \ u=v\,,\quad\big[\Pi(\te_v a)h\big](u)=0_{\h_u}\ \ \textrm{ if}\ \ u\ne v\,.$$
It follows immediately that if $\Pi$ is injective, then the restriction
of $\pi$ to $\mathfrak C_v$ is also injective, i. e. isometric. Actually
$\Pi$ extends to the full $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ of
the Fell bundle, which contains densely
$\ell^{\infty}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ . Injective representations of
$C^*$-algebras do exist; we conclude that the Fell bundle representation
$\pi$ is isometric on the $C^*$-algebras corresponding to the units. But
then, by a standard argument, the isometry also propagates on all the
Banach spaces of the Fell bundle: if $b\in\mathfrak C_x$ the axioms
allow us to write
$$\p\!\pi(b)\!\p_{\mathfrak B_x}^2=\,\p\!\pi(b)^*\pi(b)\!\p_{\mathfrak B_{\textrm{ s}(x)}}=\,\p\!\pi\big(b^\bu\bu b\big)\!\p_{\mathfrak B_{\textrm{ s}(x)}}=\,\p\!b^\bu\bu b\!\p_{\mathfrak C_{\textrm{ s}(x)}}
=\,\p\!b\!\p_{\mathfrak C_x}^2.$$

Now define
$$\Upsilon_\pi\!:\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)\to\ell^{\infty,1}\big(\Xi\,\big\vert\,\mathscr B^\mathscr H\big)\,,\quad\big(\Upsilon_\pi(\Phi)\big)(x)\!:=\pi\big(\Phi(x)\big)\,.$$
It is a well-defined linear isometry: we compute for the range part of
the norm [\[parts\]](#parts){reference-type="eqref" reference="parts"}
(using more detailed notations); the same is true for the source part.
$$\begin{aligned}
\p\!\Upsilon_\pi(\Phi)\!\p^{\textrm{ r}}_{\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\,\vert\,\mathscr B^\mathscr H)}\,&=\sup_u\!\sum_{\textrm{ r}(x)=u}\!\p\!\pi\big(\Phi(x)\big)\!\p_{\mathfrak B_x}\\
&=\sup_u\!\sum_{\textrm{ r}(x)=u}\!\p\!\Phi(x)\!\p_{\mathfrak C_x}=\,\p\!\Phi\!\p^{\textrm{ r}}_{\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\mid\mathscr C)}.
\end{aligned}$$ It is also an involutive morphism. For the
multiplication, for instance, we have: $$\begin{aligned}
\big[\Upsilon_\pi(\Phi)\star\Upsilon_\pi(\Psi)\big](\Xi)&=\sum_{yz=x}\big[\Upsilon_\pi(\Phi)\big](y)\big[\Upsilon_\pi(\Psi)\big](z)\\
&=\sum_{yz=x}\pi[\Phi(y)]\pi[\Psi(z)]\\
&=\pi\Big(\sum_{yz=x}\Phi(y)\bu\Psi(z)\Big)\\
&=\big[\pi(\Phi\star\Psi)\big](x)\\
&=\big[\Upsilon_\pi(\Phi\star\Psi)\big](x)\,.
\end{aligned}$$

Thus we proved that $\ell^{\infty,1}(\Xi\!\mid\!\mathscr C)$ can be
embedded as a closed $^*$-algebra of the symmetric Banach $^*$-algebra
$\ell^{\infty,1}\big(\Xi\,\big\vert\,\mathscr B^\mathscr H\big)$ , so it
is also symmetric, by [@Pa2 Th.11.4.2]. The proof is finished. ◻

::: example
[]{#purgrupal label="purgrupal"} If $\Xi\equiv\textsf{ H}$ is a discrete
group with unit $\e$ , one recovers the first part of Theorem
[\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref" reference="teoremix"}
(the second one may be found in [@JM]). In this case, since $U=\{\e\}$ ,
the $\ell^{\infty,1}$-algebras reduce to the usual $\ell^1$-algebras
associated to Fell bundles with discrete groups [@FD2]. The Hilbert
bundle reduces to a single Hilbert space $\h_{\e}=:\h$ , the Fell bundle
$\mathscr B^\mathscr H$ is only composed of $\mathbb B(\h)$  and then
$\ell^{\infty,1}\big(\textsf{H}\,\big\vert\,\mathscr B^\mathscr H\big)$
becomes $\ell^1\big(\textsf{H},\mathbb B(\h)\big)$ , which is isomorphic
to the projective tensor product
$\ell^1(\textsf{H})\!\otimes\!\mathbb B(\h)$ . We recover in the case
the classical notion of rigidly symmetric group; see [@Po]. This
explains a posteriori our terminology.
