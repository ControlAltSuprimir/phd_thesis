## Inverse closed Banach \*-algebras from topological partial actions {#restrix}

We introduce now certain partial crossed product $C^*$-algebras
associated to partial topological actions of the discrete group. We do
not consider the most general case; in particular, we restrict
generality in such a way to have certain natural faithful Hilbert space
representations. In this way, transparent results on inverse closedness
will be available.

So let $(X,\Theta,\G)$ be a *partial action* of the group $\G$ (assumed
here to be countable) on the compact Hausdorff space $X$. In more
detail, the partial action is denoted by
$\big\{\Theta_g:X_{g^{-1}}\!\to X_g\,\big\vert\, g\in\G\big\}$ , where
each $X_g$ is an open subset of $X$ and $\Theta_g$ is a homeomorphism
with domain $X_{g^{-1}}$ and image $X_g$ . One requires

-   $X_\e=X$ and $\Theta_\e=\textrm{id}_X$ ,

-   for every $g,h\in\G$ , the homeomorphism $\Theta_{gh}$ extends
    $\Theta_{g}\circ\Theta_{h}$.

Observe that the composition $\Theta_g\circ\Theta_h$ is meant to refer
to the map whose domain is the set of all elements $x \in X$ for which
$\Theta_g\circ\Theta_h(x)$ is well defined, therefore the domain of
$\Theta_g\circ\Theta_h$ is the set $\Theta_h^{-1}( X_h\cap X_{g^{-1}})$.

In fact each locally compact partial dynamical system may be deduced by
restricting a global one in an essentially canonical way: there exists a
global action $\tau$ of the group $G$ on a topological space $\tilde{X}$
such that
$$X_g=\tau_g(\tilde{X})\cap \tilde{X} \quad \quad \forall g\in G$$ and
$\tau_g|_{X_{g^{-1}}}=\Theta_g$ [@Ex2 Ch. 3]. But this restriction of
the global action might fail in the case the total space $\tilde X$ is
not Hausdorff ([@Ex2 Prop. 5.6] and [@Ab Th. 4.44]).

We obtain from $(X,\Theta,\G)$ a partial $C^*$-dynamical system
$\big(C(X),\te,\G\big)$ , where the ideals are $$\label{santodomingo}
\mathcal A_g\!:=C\big(X_{g}\big)\equiv\big\{a\in C(X)\,\big\vert\,a(x)=0\,,\,\forall\,x\notin X_{g}\big\}$$
and the isomorphisms are $$\label{panama}
\te_g:C\big(X_{g^{-1}}\big)\to C\big(X_{g}\big)\,,\quad\te_g(a):=a\circ\Theta_{g^{-1}}\,.$$
Therefore, one can construct the Banach $^*$-algebra
$\ell^1_\te\big(\G;C(X)\big)$ and its enveloping partial crossed product
$C(X)\!\rtt_\te\!\G$ . We deduce from Theorem
[\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref" reference="teoremix"}

::: proposition
[]{#corolix label="corolix"} If $\,\normalfont{\G}$ is rigidly
symmetric, $\ell^1_\te\big(\normalfont{\G},C(X)\big)$ is reduced,
symmetric and inverse closed in the partial crossed product.
:::

Assume now that under the partial action there is an open dense orbit
$Y$ with trivial isotropy. Thus, for some (and then any) $y\in Y$ one
has $$\label{guadelupa}
\G(y):=\big\{g\in\G\,\big\vert\,y\in X_{g^{-1}}\,,\Theta_g(y)=y\big\}=\{\e\}\,.$$
Then $X$ will be a compactification of the discrete orbit $Y$ and for
any $y\in Y$ the orbit map $g\to\Theta_g(y)$ will be a homeomorphism on
its image.

In the Hilbert space $\ell^2\big(Y\big)$ we introduce the representation
by multiplication operators $$\label{mexic}
\pi:C(X)\to\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(Y)\big]\,,\quad\big[\pi(a)\xi\big](y):=a(y)\xi(y)\,.$$
For any $h\in\G\,,\,y\in Y$ and $\xi\in\ell^2(Y)$ one defines
$$\label{partilix}
\big[u_h(\xi)\big](y):=
\begin{cases}
\xi\big(\Theta_{h^{-1}}(y)\big) &\textrm{if}\ \;y\in X_h\,,\\
0\, &\textrm{if}\ \;y\notin X_h\,.
\end{cases}$$ Then $\big(\pi,u,\ell^2(Y)\big)$ *is a covariant
representation of* $\big(C(X),\te,\G\big)$ and *the integrated form
representation*
$$\Pi\equiv\pi\!\rtt u\!:C(X)\!\rtt_\te\!\G\to\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(Y)\big]\,,$$
which acts on $\ell^1_\te\big(\G;C(X)\big)$ as
$\Pi(\Phi)=\sum_{h\in\G}\pi\big[\Phi(h)\big]u_h$ and which satisfies
$$\label{lemikainnen}
\Pi\big(a\otimes\delta_h\big)=\pi(a)u_h\,,\quad\forall\,h\in\G\,,\,a\in C(X_h)\,.$$
To express it explicitly, we need some notations. For $y,z\in Y$ we set
$g_{yz}$ for the unique element of the group such that
$\Theta_{g_{yz}}(y)=z$ ; we use the fact that $Y$ is an orbit with
trivial isotropy. Note the relations $$\label{dominicana}
g_{yz}^{-1}=g_{zy}\,,\quad g_{zy}=g_{xy}g_{zx}\,,\quad\forall\,x,y,z\in Y.$$
A direct computation, relying on
[\[dominicana\]](#dominicana){reference-type="eqref"
reference="dominicana"}, shows that on $\ell^1_\te\big(\G;C(X)\big)$ the
representation $\Pi$ reads $$\label{flochax}
\big[\Pi(\Phi)\xi\big](y)=\sum_{z\in Y}\Phi\big(g_{zy},y\big)\xi(z)\,,$$
where we set $\big[\Phi(k)\big](y)=:\Phi(k,y)$ .

[]{#pohjola label="pohjola"} Suppose that $\normalfont{\G}$ is countable
and rigidly symmetric and that $Y$ is a open dense orbit of the space
$X$, with trivial isotropy. Let
$\Phi\in\ell^1_\te\big(\normalfont{\G};C(X)\big)$ .

1.  If the operator $\,\Pi(\Phi)$ is invertible, there exists
    $\Psi\in\ell^1_\te\big(\normalfont{\G};C(X)\big)$ such that
    $\Pi(\Phi)^{-1}\!=\Pi(\Psi)$ .

2.  If $\,\Pi(\Phi)$ is Fredholm, at least one of its inverses $T$
    modulo $\mathbb K\big[\ell^2(Y)\big]$ belongs to
    $\Pi[\ell^1_{\theta}\big(\normalfont{\G};C(X)\big)]$ .
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* (i) Having in view Proposition
[\[corolix\]](#corolix){reference-type="ref" reference="corolix"}, we
only need to check that the representation $\Pi$ is faithful; see also
Theorem [\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref"
reference="teoremix"}(iv). The universal and the reduced partial crossed
products here are the same, cf. Remark
[\[lantors\]](#lantors){reference-type="ref" reference="lantors"}. Note
that the restriction of $\Pi$ to $C(X)$ coincides with $\pi$ (set $h=\e$
in [\[lemikainnen\]](#lemikainnen){reference-type="eqref"
reference="lemikainnen"}). By [@ELQ Th. 2.6], injectivity of $\Pi$ would
follow if we prove that $\pi$ is injective and the action is
topologically free. The injectivity of $\pi$ is obvious: $\pi(a)=0$
means that the restriction of $a$ to $Y$ is null, which implies that $a$
is null, since the orbit $Y$ was supposed dense. Topological freeness
(cf. [@ELQ Def. 2.1.]) is clear, since $Y$ is dense: having trivial
isotropy, it is disjoint from any set of the form
$$F_g:=\big\{x\in X_{g^{-1}}\,\big\vert\,\Theta_g(x)=x\big\}\,,\quad g\ne\e\,,$$
so this one must have empty interior.

\(ii\) Since $Y$ is discrete, the elements of $C_0(Y)$ are transformed
by the representation $\pi$ into compact multiplication operators in
$\ell^2(Y)$ . The $\te$-invariant ideal $C_0(Y)$ gives rise to the ideal
$C_0(Y)\!\rightthreetimes_\te\!\G$ of the partial crossed product
$C(X)\!\rtt_\te\!\G$ and one has
$\Pi\big[C_0(Y)\!\rtt_\te\!\G\big]=\mathbb K\big[\ell^2(Y)\big]$ .
Therefore one can apply Corollary
[\[honduras\]](#honduras){reference-type="ref" reference="honduras"} and
conclude that
$\Pi[\ell^1_{\theta}\big(\G;C(X)\big)]\subset\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(Y)\big]$
is Fredholm inverse closed. Then the assertion follows easily from
Atkinson's Theorem; see also Example
[\[fredholmix\]](#fredholmix){reference-type="ref"

## Toeplitz-Bunce-Deddens operators {#dedenix}

In the Hilbert space $\ell^2(\N)$ , with canonical orthonormal base
$\{\delta_n\}_{n\in\N}$ , each function $a\in\ell^\infty(\N)$ defines a
bounded multiplication operator $\textsf{M}_a$ . Let us denote by
$\textsf{S}$ the right shift uniquely determined by
$\textsf{S}\,\delta_n\!:=\delta_{n+1}$ for every $n\in\N$ . For
$q\in\N$ , we say that $a\in\ell^\infty(\N)$ is $q$-periodic if
$a(n+q)=a(n)\,,\,\forall\,n\in\N$ . We denote by $\ell^\infty(\N;q)$ the
$C^*$-subalgebra of all $q$-periodic functions. The starting point in
constructing a Toeplitz-Bunce-Deddens algebra is an infinite family
$\mathbf q:=\{q_i\!\mid\!i\in\N\}$ of strictly increasing positive
integers such that each $q_i$ divides $q_{i+1}$ , i.e. $q_{i+1}=r_i q_i$
with $r_i\ge 2$ .

$\ell^1\big[\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)\big]$ is reduced, symmetric and
inverse closed in $\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)$ and in
$\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(\N)\big]$ (an explicit description is included in
the proof).
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* By [@Exs1], a canonical action $\alpha$ of the torus
$\mathbb T=\widehat\Z$ on $\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)$ is defined as
follows: For every $z\in\mathbb T$ the unitary multiplication operator
determined by $U_z\delta_n:=z^n\delta_n$ ($n\in\N$) defines on
$\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(\N)\big]$ the inner automorphism
$T\to U_z TU_z^*$. Because of $$\label{costarica}
\alpha_z(S_a)=U_z S_aU_z^*=zS_a\,,\quad\forall\,a\in\ell^\infty(\N)\,,$$
$\big(\mathfrak D(\mathbf q),\alpha,\T\big)$ is indeed a (full)
continuous action. We also write $\ell^\infty(\N;\mathbf q)$ for the
(unital, Abelian) $C^*$-subalgebra of $\ell^\infty(\N)$ generated by
$\bigcup_{i\in\N}\ell^\infty(\N;q_i)$ . The spectral subspace
$\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)_k$ is generated by operators of the ordered form
$$\label{paracetamol}
S_{a_1}\dots S_{a_n}S^*_{b_1}\dots S^*_{b_m}\,,\quad a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_m\in\ell^\infty(\N;\mathbf q)\,,\ n-m=k\,.$$
This follows easily from the relations $S^*_a S_b=M_{\overline ab}$ and
$M_a S_b=S_{\tilde ab}$ , where $\tilde a_n:=a_{n-1}$ if $n\ge 1$ .
Since $\tilde a_0$ does not appear in the definition of the weighted
shift operator, it can be fixed such that $\tilde a$ is periodic. Other
forms of the elements in $\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)_k$ could involve the
final projection $Q:=SS^*$. These having been settled, the assertions
concerning the $\ell^1$-Banach algebra follow from Theorem
[\[exelix\]](#exelix){reference-type="ref" reference="exelix"}. ◻
:::

::: remark
[]{#toeplix label="toeplix"} In [@Exs1] one gets the isomorphism
$$\label{triplix}
\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}\big[c_0(\N)\oplus\ell^\infty(\N;\mathbf q)\big]\!\rtt_\te\Z\cong C\big[\N(\mathbf q)\big]\!\rtt_\te\Z\,.$$
We refer to [@Exs1] for the Gelfand spectrum
$\N(\mathbf q)=\N\sqcup\Si(\mathbf q)$ of the Abelian $\alpha$-fixed
point $C^*$-algebra
$$\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)_0\!:=c_0(\N)\oplus\ell^\infty(\N;\mathbf q)$$
(a compactification of the discrete set $\N$ by a Cantor set
$\Si(\mathbf q)$) and for the interesting explicit form of the partial
action $\te$ in the Gelfand realization (induced by a partial
homeomorphism of $\N(\mathbf q)$).
:::

We may also state that
*$\ell^1\big[\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)\big]=\bigoplus_{k\in\Z}^{1,\alpha}\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)_k$
is Fredholm inverse closed in*
$\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)\subset\mathbb B\big[\ell^2(\N)\big]$ . This
follows from Corollary [\[honduras\]](#honduras){reference-type="ref"
reference="honduras"}, where $\K=c_0(\N)$ and $\Pi$ is the inverse of
the isomorphism appearing in
[\[triplix\]](#triplix){reference-type="eqref" reference="triplix"},
since
$\Pi\big[c_0(\N)\!\rtt_\te\!\Z\big]=\mathbb K\big[\ell^2(\N)\big]$ . One
calls the quotient $$\label{triflix}
\mathfrak D(\mathbf q)/\mathbb K\big[\ell^2(\N)\big]\cong\ell^\infty(\N;\mathbf q)\!\rtimes_\te\Z\cong C\big[\Si(\mathbf q)\big]\!\rtimes_\te\Z$$
*the Bunce-Deddens algebra*. The action \"at infinity\" of $\Z$ on the
Cantor set $\Si(\mathbf q)$ is induced by an odometer map. It is a
global action, so this quotient can be dealt with by usual crossed
products.

## UHF algebras {#afelliz}

*An UHF-algebra* is the inductive limit $$\label{limindiz}
\mathfrak C:=\underset{m\in\N}{\textrm{ lim\,ind}\,\mathbf M^{p_m}}$$ of
a sequence of full matricial $C^*$-algebras, with unital and injective
connecting morphisms, where each $p_m$ divides $p_{m+1}$. In [@Exs2]
Exel treated general approximately finite algebras. He defined on
$\mathfrak C$ a regular and semi-saturated $\mathbb T$-action and then
he applied his theory from [@Exs] to get an isomorphism between
$\mathfrak C$ and a partial crossed product $\A\rtt_\te\Z$ , where $\A$
is an Abelian almost finite $AF$-algebra. To simplify, we decided to
treat only UHF algebras; the general case is similar, but it would
involve more complicated notations. To state a result on symmetric
subalgebras, we make use of Theorem
[\[exelix\]](#exelix){reference-type="ref" reference="exelix"}, only
invoking the circle action and its spectral subspaces; the partial
crossed product will not be mentioned.

On every full matrix algebra $\mathbf M^p$ one defines $$\label{inerix}
\alpha^p:\mathbb T\to\textrm{ Aut}\big(\mathbf M^p\big)\,,\quad\alpha^p_z\big[(c_{ij})_{i,j}\big]=\big(z^{i-j}c_{ij}\big)_{i,j}\,.$$
The connecting morphisms
$\big\{\mu^{m}\!:\!\mathbf M^{p_m}\to\mathbf M^{p_{m+1}}\big\}$ are
covariant with respect to the actions $\big\{\alpha^{p_m}\big\}$. The
inductive limit comes with the canonical monomorphisms
$\big\{\nu^{m}\!:\mathbf M^{p_m}\!\to\mathfrak C\big\}$ and
$\bigcup_m\nu^{(m)}\!\big(\mathbf M^{p_m}\big)$ is dense in
$\mathfrak C$ . For every $z\in\mathbb T\,,m\in\N$ and
$\Phi\in\mathbf M^{p_m}$ we set $$\label{tetaniz}
\alpha_z\big[\nu^{m}(\Phi)\big]:=\nu^{m}\big[\alpha^{p_m}_z(\Phi)\big]\,.$$
It is shown in [@Exs2 Sect. 2] that $\alpha$ extends to an action on
$\mathfrak C$ (which is semi-saturated and regular).

To make Theorem [\[exelix\]](#exelix){reference-type="ref"
reference="exelix"} concrete, one needs the spectral subspaces. For each
$|k|\le p$ , let us denote by $\mathbf M^p_k$ the vector subspace of
$p\!\times\!p$-matrices with non-empty entries only on the $k'$th
diagonal ($c_{ij}=0$ if $i-j\ne k$). If $|k|>p$ , we set simply
$\mathbf M^p_k\!:=\{0\}$ . Then $\mathbf M^p_k$ is the $k'$th spectral
subspace of the action $\alpha^p$. It is follows from the definitions
and from the fact that each canonical morphism $\nu^{m}$ is injective
that the spectral subspaces of the action $\alpha$ are the closures in
$\mathfrak C$ of the unions over $m$ of the images through $\nu^{m}$ of
the subspaces $\mathbf M^{p_m}_k$.

::: theorem
[]{#cioflix label="cioflix"} The Banach $^*$-algebra $$\label{perru}
\ell^1(\mathfrak C)=\bigoplus^{1,\alpha}_{k\in\N}\overline{\bigcup_{m\in\Z}\nu^{m}\big(\mathbf M^{p_m}_k\big)}$$
is reduced, symmetric and inverse closed in $\mathfrak C$ .
:::

::: remark
[]{#takesix label="takesix"} In [@Ta] Takesaki (see also [@FD2 VIII.17])
provided an approach to UHF algebras which would lead to a different
grading, and consequently also to a symmetric $\ell^1$-type Banach
$^*$-algebra, this time over the infinite restricted product
$\G:=\prod^\prime_{m\in\N}\G_m$ with the discrete topology, where each
$\G_m$ is a cyclic group of a certain order $q_m$ . Actually, the UHF
algebra $\mathfrak C$ is isomorphic to an infinite tensor product
$\otimes_m\mathbf M^{q_m}$, where $q_m:=p_{m+1}/p_m$ . In its turn, this
one is shown to be isomorphic to the full crossed product
$C(\widehat\G\,)\!\rtimes\G$ . The dual $\widehat\G$ can be identified
with the product group $\prod_{m\in\N}\G_m$ .

## CAR algebras {#afellix}

Let $\big(\mathcal R,(\cdot|\cdot)\big)$ be an infinitely dimensional
separable Hilbert space and $a:\mathcal R\to\mathbb B(\mathcal H)$ *a
representation of the canonical anticommutation relations* in the
Hilbert space $\h$ , generating the unital $C^*$-algebra
$\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)\subset\mathbb B(\mathcal H)$ . Thus $a$ is
lineal and for every $r,s\in\mathcal R$ one has $$\label{anticom}
a(r)a(s)+a(s)a(r)=0\,,\quad a^*(r)a(s)+a^*(s)a(r)=(r|s)\,.$$ It is known
that $\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)$ is isomorphic to the UHF algebra
$\mathbf M(2^\infty):=\underset{m\in\N}{\textrm{ lim\,ind}\,\mathbf M^{2^m}}$
as well as with the infinite tensor product
$\bigotimes_{m\in\N}\mathbf M^2$.

Let also $V:\wG\to\mathbb B(\mathcal R)$ be a strongly continuous
unitary representation of the compact Abelian group $\wG$ . Associated
to $V$ there is a continuous action
$\upsilon:\wG\to\textrm{ Aut}\big[\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)\big]$ ,
uniquely defined on generators by $$\label{creatrix}
\upsilon_\chi\big[a(r)\big]=a\big[V_\chi(r)\big]\,,\quad\forall\,r\in\mathcal R\,,\,\chi\in\wG\,.$$

We denote by $\G$ the dual of $\wG$ ; it is a discrete Abelian group. We
already have the grading $$\label{carnatix}
\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)=\widetilde\bigoplus_{g\in\G}\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_g$$
in terms of spectral subspaces of the action $\upsilon$ . The next
corollary follows directly from Theorem
[\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref" reference="teoremix"}.
Note the generality: any representation $\big(\wG,V\big)$ provides a
result.

::: corollary
[]{#spermioni label="spermioni"} The corresponding $\ell^1$-algebra
$$\label{sperioni}
\ell^1\big(\textrm{CCR}(\mathcal R)\big)=\bigoplus_{g\in\normalfont{\G}}^{1,\upsilon}\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_g$$
is symmetric and inverse closed in $\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)$ and in
$\mathbb B(\mathcal H)$ .
:::

It is clear that $a(r)\in\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_g$ if and
only if $r\in\mathcal R^V_g$, meaning by definition that
$V_\chi(r)=\chi(g)r$ for all $\chi\in\wG$ . Similarly,
$a^*(r)\in\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_g$ if and only if
$r\in\mathcal R^V_{g^{-1}}$ .

$\mathcal R^V_1=\mathcal R$ , while $\mathcal R^V_k=\{0\}$ for any
$k\ne 1$ . Thus $a(r)\in\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_1$ and
$a^*(r)\in\textrm{ CCR}(\mathcal R)^{\upsilon}_{-1}$ , from which it
follows that $$\label{followix}

## Wiener-Hopf algebras associated to quasi-lattice ordered groups {#quasilatix}

One can treat this subject by using partial crossed products, as in
Subsection [\[cerculix\]](#cerculix){reference-type="ref"
reference="cerculix"}, due to results from [@QR; @ELQ; @Ex2]. We found
it easier for our purposes to use the initial article [@Ni], combined
with Theorem [\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref"
reference="teoremix"}.

We fix a sub-monoid $\pe$ of a discrete amenable group $\G$ such that
$\pe\cap\pe^{-1}=\{\e\}$ . One defines a left-invariant order relation
in $\G$ by $g\leq h$ iff $g^{-1}h\in \pe$. The ordered group $(\G,\pe)$
is *quasi-lattice ordered* if any $g\in\pe\pe^{-1}$ has a least upper
bound in $\pe$. Many examples may be found at [@Ni pag.23].

Consider the Hilbert space $\ell^2(\pe)$ with its usual orthonormal
basis $\{e_q\}_{q\in\pe}$. For $p\in\pe$, consider the bounded linear
operator $W_p\in \mathbb{B}(\ell^2(\pe))$ defined by
$$W_p(e_q)=e_{pq}\,,\quad\forall\,q\in\pe.$$ We refer to $W$ as the
*regular semigroup of isometries* of $\pe$. The $C^*$-algebra of
operators on $\ell^2(\pe)$ generated by the range of $W$ is called the
*Wiener-Hopf algebra of $\,\pe$* is denoted by $\mathfrak{W}(\pe)$ .

For every $g\in\pe\pe^{-1}$ we define the closed subspace
$$\mathfrak{W}(\pe)_g:=\overline{\textrm{span}}\,\big\{W_p W_q^*\,\big\vert\,pq^{-1}\!=g\big\}$$
and set $\mathfrak{W}(\pe)_g=\{0\}$ if $g\notin \pe\pe^{-1}$. A
characterization of the Abelian $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathfrak{W}(\pe)_\e$
is
$$\mathfrak{W}(\pe)_\e =\left\{T\in\mathfrak{W}(\pe)\!\mid\! T \textrm{ has a diagonal matrix relatively to the canonical basis of }\ell^2(\pe)\right\}.$$
In Section 3 of Nica's paper [@Ni] it is shown that that *the collection
$\big\{\mathfrak{W}(\pe)_g\,\big\vert\,g\in\G\big\}$ provides a
topologically graded structure of the Wiener-Hopf algebra*. We can apply
now Theorem [\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref"
reference="teoremix"} and get

[]{#spresfarsit label="spresfarsit"} Suppose that $\normalfont{\pe}$ is
finitely generated (a slightly more general assumption is possible).
Then
$\ell^1\Big( \widehat{\bigoplus}_{g\in\normalfont{\G}}\,\mathfrak{W}(\normalfont{\pe})_g \Big)$
*is also Fredholm inverse closed*. We only sketch a proof. As in
[@QR; @ELQ; @Ex2], one has an isomorphism
$\mathfrak W(\normalfont{\pe})\cong\mathfrak W(\normalfont{\pe})_\e\rtt_\te\normalfont{\G}$
for a certain partial action $\te$ of $\normalfont{\G}$ on the diagonal
Abelian algebra. This one is induced from a (Bernoulli-type) partial
topological action $\Theta$ on its Gelfand spectrum $\Omega_\e$ , which
is a compactification of the monoid $\normalfont{\pe}$. This
compactification is regular ($\normalfont{\pe}$ is an *open* dense
orbit) under the stated hypothesis on $\normalfont{\pe}$. It is shown in
[@Ni 6.3] that this regularity is equivalent with the fact that the
ideal of all compact operators, identified with
$C(\normalfont{\pe})\rtt_\te\normalfont{\G}$ , is contained in
$\mathfrak W(\normalfont{\pe})\,.$ Then the result follows easily from
our Corollary [\[honduras\]](#honduras){reference-type="ref"

## Higher rank graph algebras {#oroflix}

$\big(\textrm{ l}:\Lambda\to\N^\textrm{ k}\big)$ , one denotes by

[]{#cstarix label="cstarix"} Let
$\Lambda\overset{\textrm{ l}}{\longrightarrow}\N^\textrm{ k}$ be an
admissible $\textrm{ k}$-graph. *A Cuntz-Krieger $\Lambda$-family* is a
set $\{\textsf{ T}_\lambda\!\mid\!\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ of partial
isometries in a $C^*$-algebra $\mathfrak D$ such that

1.  the elements $\big\{\textsf{ T}_v\!\mid\!v\in\Lambda^0\big\}$ are
    mutually orthogonal projections,

2.  if $\textrm{ s}(\lambda)=\textrm{ r}(\mu)$ , then
    $\textsf{ T}_\lambda\textsf{ T}_\mu=\textsf{ T}_{\lambda\mu}$ ,

3.  $\textsf{ T}^*_\lambda\textsf{ T}_\lambda=\textsf{ T}_{\textrm{ s}(\lambda)}$
    for every $\lambda\in\Lambda$ ,

4.  $\textsf{ T}_v=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda^{\mathfrak n}(v)}\textsf{ T}_\lambda\textsf{ T}^*_\lambda$
    for every $v\in\Lambda^0$ and $\mathfrak n\in\N^\textrm{ k}$.

We define $C^*(\Lambda,\textrm{ l})\equiv\mathfrak C(\Lambda)$ to be the
universal $C^*$-algebra generated by a Cuntz-Krieger $\Lambda$-family
$\{\textsf{ S}_\lambda\!\mid\!\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ . Universality means
that for every Cuntz-Krieger $\Lambda$-family
$\{\textsf{ T}_\lambda\!\mid\!\lambda\in\Lambda\}\subset\mathfrak D$ ,
there exists a unique $C^*$-morphism
$\pi_\textsf{ T}:\mathfrak C(\Lambda)\to\mathfrak D$ such that
$\pi_\textsf{ T}(\textsf{ S}_\lambda)=\textsf{ T}_\lambda$ for every
$\lambda$ .
:::

We identify now families of symmetric Banach $^*$-algebras, starting
with functors $\textsf{ F}:\Lambda\to\G$ , where $\G$ is supposed to be
a discrete Abelian group. One particular case is $\G=\N^\textrm{ k}$ and
$\textsf{ F}=\textrm{ l}$ , but many others are possible. For every
$g\in\G$ one sets $$\label{bebex}
\mathfrak{C}(\Lambda)_g:=\overline{\textrm{ span}}\big\{\textsf{ S}_\lambda\textsf{ S}^*_{\mu}\,{\big\vert\,\textsf{ F}}(\lambda)\textsf{ F}(\mu)^{-1}=g\big\}\,.$$
It turns out that these are spectral subspaces of a dual action
$\alpha^\textsf{ F}:\wG\to\textrm{ Aut}\big[\mathfrak C(\Lambda)\big]$ ,
uniquely determined (use the universal property of
$\mathfrak C(\Lambda)$) by
$$\alpha^\textsf{ F}_\chi(\textsf{ S}_\lambda)=\chi\big[\textsf{ F}(\lambda)\big]\textsf{ S}_\lambda\,,\quad\forall\,\lambda\in\Lambda\,,\,\chi\in\wG\,.$$

[]{#ix label="ix"} Let
$\Lambda\overset{\textrm{ l}}{\longrightarrow}\N^\textrm{ k}$ be an

is a reduced and symmetric Banach $^*$-algebra, which is inverse closed
in $\mathfrak C(\Lambda)$ .

[]{#aperiodix label="aperiodix"} On $\N^\textsf{ k}$ one considers the
order
$\mathfrak m\le\mathfrak n\,\Leftrightarrow\,\mathfrak m_i\le\mathfrak n_i\,,\forall\,i$ .
Let $\Lambda\overset{\textrm{ l}}{\longrightarrow}\N^\textrm{ k}$ be an
admissible $\textrm{ k}$-graph.

1.  We say that $\rho$ is *a minimal common extension* of
    $\mu,\nu\in\Lambda$ , and we write $\rho\in\textrm{ MCE}(\mu,\nu)$ ,
    if $\textrm{ l}(\rho)=\max\{\textrm{ l}(\mu),\textrm{ l}(\nu)\}$ and
    $\rho=\mu\mu'=\nu\nu'$ for some $\mu',\nu'\in\Lambda$ .

2.  The $\textsf{ k}$-graph is called *aperiodic* if for every
    $\mu,\nu\in\Lambda$ with $\textrm{ s}(\mu)=\textrm{ s}(\nu)$ there
    exists $\lambda\in\Lambda$ with
    $\textrm{ r}(\lambda)=\textrm{ s}(\mu)$ and
    $\textrm{ MCE}(\mu\lambda,\nu\lambda)=\emptyset$ .
:::

The two notions are easier to visualize for $\textsf{ k}=1$ . In this
case, for instance, $\textrm{ MCE}(\mu,\nu)$ is either void, or a
singleton (one of the two elements) and aperiodicity boils down to
condition (L).

::: proposition
[]{#perdrix label="perdrix"} Let
$\Lambda\overset{\textrm{ l}}{\longrightarrow}\N^\textrm{ k}$ be an
admissible and aperiodic $\textrm{ k}$-graph and
$\textsf{ F}:\Lambda\to\normalfont{\G}$ a functor with values in an
Abelian discrete group. Let
$\{\textsf{ T}_\lambda\!\mid\!\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ be a Cuntz-Krieger
$\Lambda$-family of partial isometries in the Hilbert space $\h$ such
that $\textsf{ T}_v\ne 0$ for every $v\in\Lambda^0$. Then (the quite
obvious action $\beta^\textsf{ F}$ is explained in the proof)
$$\label{fujimori}
\bigoplus_{g\in\normalfont{\G}}^{1,\beta^{\textsf{ F}}}\,\overline{\textrm{ span}}\big\{\textsf{ T}_\lambda\textsf{ T}^*_{\mu}\,{\big\vert\,\textsf{ F}}(\lambda)\textsf{ F}(\mu)^{-1}\!=g\big\}$$
is inverse closed in $\mathbb B(\h)$ .
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Under the stated assumptions, \"the Cuntz-Krieger unicity
theorem\" (see [@KP; @Si] for example) states that the unique
representation $\pi_\textsf{ T}:\mathfrak C(\Lambda)\to\mathbb B(\h)$
satisfying
$$\pi_{\textsf{T}}(\textsf{ S}_{\lambda})=\textsf{ T}_{\lambda}\,,\quad\forall\lambda\in\Lambda$$
(provided by the universal property) is injective. We denote by
$\mathfrak C(\textsf{ T})$ its range, so that $\mathfrak C(\Lambda)$ and
$\mathfrak C(\textsf{ T})$ are isomorphic. Theorem
[\[teoremix\]](#teoremix){reference-type="ref" reference="teoremix"}
states then that
$\pi_\textsf{ T}\Big[\ell^1\big(\mathfrak C(\Lambda)\big)\Big]$ is
inverse closed in $\mathfrak C(\textsf{ T})$ and in $\mathbb B(\h)$ .
There is an action
$\beta^\textsf{ F}\!:\wG\to\textrm{ Aut}\big[\mathfrak C(\textsf{ T})\big]$
such that
$$\beta^\textsf{ F}_\chi(\textsf{ T}_\lambda)=\chi[\textsf{ F}(\lambda)]\textsf{ T}_\lambda\,,\quad\forall\,\chi\in\wG\,,\,\lambda\in\Lambda$$
and $\pi_T$ intertwines the two actions. It follows that
$\pi_\textsf{ T}\Big[\ell^1\big(\mathfrak C(\Lambda)\big)\Big]$
coincides with [\[fujimori\]](#fujimori){reference-type="eqref"
